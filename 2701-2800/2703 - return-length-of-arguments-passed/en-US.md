# Problem

Write a function `argumentsLength` that returns the count of arguments passed to it.

## Examples

> Input: `args = [5]`

> Output: `1`

> Explanation: One value was passed to the function so it should return `1`.

** **

> Input: `args = [{}, null, "3"]`

> Output: `3`

> Explanation: Three values were passed to the function so it should return `3`.

## About my Solution

Scroll through the entire array and increment a number stored in a variable.

### Key-points

- Use the `length` method on the array to get the expected result.
- Reduce time to O(1) instead of O(N).

### Codes

> Languages in which I maked this Solution: `JavaScript` and `TypeScript`.
